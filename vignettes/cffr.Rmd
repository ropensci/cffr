**cffr** is a tool whose target audience are **R** package developers. The main
goal of **cffr** is to create a `CITATION.cff` file using the metadata
information of the following files:

-   Your `DESCRIPTION` file.
-   If available, the citation information located in `inst/CITATION`.

## What is a `CITATION.cff` file?

[Citation File Format (CFF](https://citation-file-format.github.io/))
[@druskat_citation_2021] (v1.2.0) are plain text files with human- and
machine-readable citation information for software (and datasets). Code
developers can include them in their repositories to let others know how to
correctly cite their software.

This format is becoming popular within the software citation ecosystem. Recently
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files),
[Zenodo](https://citation-file-format.github.io/#/supported-by-zenodo-) and
[Zotero](https://citation-file-format.github.io/#/supported-by-zotero-) have
included full support of this citation format [@druskat_stephan_making_2021].

GitHub support is of special interest:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="400", fig.align='center', fig.alt="GitHub-link"}
knitr::include_graphics("tweet-1.png")
```

## Creating a `CITATION.cff` file for my R package

With **cffr** creating a `CITATION.cff` file is quite straightforward. You just
need to run `cff_write()`:

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
library(cffr)

cff_write()

# You are done!
```

Under the hood, `cff_write()` performs the following tasks:

-   It extracts the metadata using `cff_create()`.
-   Writes a `CITATION.cff` file using `yaml::write_yaml()`.
-   Validates the result using `cff_validate()`.

Congratulations! Now you have a full `CITATION.cff` file for your **R** package.

## Modifying your `CITATION.cff` file

You can easily customize the `cff` object (a custom class of **cffr**) using the
parsers provided in the package, as well as making use of the `keys` parameter.

We would create a `cff` object using `cff()` (for example purposes only) and we
would add or modify contents of it.

### Adding new fields

```{r newfields}
newobject <- cff_create(cff())

# For modifying your auto-generated object, run this line instead:
# newoobject <- cff_create()

newobject
```

The valid keys of the [Citation File Format schema version
1.2.0](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema-guide.md)
can be displayed with `cff_schema_keys()`:

```{r validkeys}
cff_schema_keys()
```

In this case, we are going to add `url`, `version` and `repository`. We would
also overwrite the `title` key. We just need to create a list and pass it to the
`keys` argument of `cff_create()`:

```{r modify}
newkeys <- list(
  "url" = "https://ropensci.org/",
  "version" = "0.0.1",
  "repository" = "https://github.com/ropensci/cffr",
  # If the field is already present, it would be overridden
  title = "Modifying a 'cff' object"
)

modobject <- cff_create(newobject, keys = newkeys)

modobject

# Validate against the schema

cff_validate(modobject)
```

### Parsing persons and citations

**cffr** provides two functions that parse `person` objects and `bibentry`
objects (See `?person` and `?bibentry`). These objects are included in the
**utils** package and are a core part of the metadata of any **R** package.

Following the previous example, we are going to add a new author first. For
doing that, we need first to extract the current author of the package and
append the parsed person:

```{r includeauthor}
# Valid person keys

cff_schema_definitions_person()

# Create the person

chiquito <- person("Gregorio",
  "Sánchez Fernández",
  email = "fake@email2.com",
  comment = c(
    alias = "Chiquito de la Calzada",
    city = "Malaga",
    country = "ES",
    ORCID = "0000-0000-0000-0001"
  )
)

chiquito

# Parse it
chiquito_parsed <- cff_parse_person(chiquito)
chiquito_parsed


# Append to previous authors

# Needs to be append as a list
newauthors <- c(modobject$authors, list(chiquito_parsed))
newauthors

newauthorobject <- cff_create(modobject, keys = list(authors = newauthors))

newauthorobject

cff_validate(newauthorobject)
```

Now, we may want to add `references` to our data. **cffr** supports two types of
references:

-   References created with `bibentry()`
-   References extracted from packages using `citation()`

On the following example, we would add two references, one of each type:

```{r parsingcits}
# Valid reference keys

cff_schema_definitions_refs()

# Auto parsed from another R package
base_r <- cff_parse_citation(citation("base"))

base_r

# Create with bibentry

bib <- bibentry("Book",
  title = "This is a book",
  author = "Lisa Lee",
  year = 1980,
  publisher = "McGraw Hill",
  volume = 2
)
bib

# Now parse it

bookparsed <- cff_parse_citation(bib)

bookparsed
```

Now the process is similar to the example with `person`: we append both
references (as lists) and add them to our object:

```{r references}
refkeys <- list(references = c(list(base_r), list(bookparsed)))

refkeys

finalobject <- cff_create(newauthorobject, keys = refkeys)

finalobject

cff_validate(finalobject)
```

### Create your modified `CITATION.cff` file

The results can be written with `cff_write()`:

```{r write}
# For example
tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".cff")

see_res <- cff_write(finalobject, outfile = tmp)

see_res
```

And finally we can read our created `CITATION.cff` file using `cff()`:

```{r read}
reading <- cff(tmp)

reading
```

Note that `cff_write()` also has the `keys` param, so the workflow can be
simplified as:

```{r}
allkeys <- list(
  "url" = "https://ropensci.org/",
  "version" = "0.0.1",
  "repository" = "https://github.com/user/repo",
  # If the field is already present, it would be overridden
  title = "Modifying a 'cff' object",
  authors = newauthors,
  references = c(list(base_r), list(bookparsed))
)

tmp2 <- tempfile(fileext = ".cff")

res <- cff_write(cff(), outfile = tmp2, keys = allkeys)

res
```
